        <h1>Welcome To Hawaii</h1>
        <p>Aloha, and welecome to my webpage! My name is Neil Knight. I am a student at Brigham-Young University Hawaii,
            and I am currently learning how to code webpages. I am excited to test my new web page coding skills by giving
            a photo tour of where I was born and raised. Hawaii is the most beautiful place in the world in my opinion and 
            there is beautiful wildlife, stunning sunsets, and pristine beaches. Hawaii is probably the best place to live
            on earth. 
        </p>
