                    <ol>
                        <li>Long Lifespan: Some turtles can live to be over 100 years old.</li>
                        <li>Ancient Reptiles: Turtles have been around for over 200 million years, even outliving the dinosaurs.</li>
                        <li>Diverse Sizes: The smallest turtle species is the speckled padloper tortoise, which is about 3 inches long. The largest is the leatherback sea turtle, which can grow up to 7 feet long and weigh over 2,000 pounds.</li>
                        <li>Great Navigators: Sea turtles can travel thousands of miles during their migrations. They use the Earth’s magnetic field to navigate.</li>
                        <li>Varied Diets: Depending on the species, turtles can be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. They might eat plants, insects, or even jellyfish.</li>
                        <li>Unique Shells: A turtle’s shell is made up of over 50 bones fused together. It's a part of their skeleton, including their ribcage and spine.</li>
                        <li>Breathing Adaptations: While many turtles breathe air, some can absorb oxygen through their skin, throat, or cloaca, allowing them to stay underwater for extended periods.</li>
                        <li>Slow Movers: Land turtles are known for their slow movement, but sea turtles can be quite speedy in the water, swimming up to 20 mph.</li>
                        <li>Lonely Eggs: Female turtles lay eggs in nests on land and then leave. The hatchlings must find their way to the water on their own.</li>
                        <li>Temperature-Dependent Gender: The temperature of the sand where a turtle's eggs are incubated determines the gender of the hatchlings. Warmer sand produces more females, while cooler sand produces more males.</li>
